This project connects a DNS server and a VPN so that you can connect to
containers in a docker network from your macOS host and resolve their names
using DNS.

* Prerequisites

** =docker-compose=
Install [[https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac][docker desktop]]

** =openvpn=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew install openvpn
#+END_SRC

Make sure to export paths for `openvpn` bin in your ~/.zshrc
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:$PATH
#+END_SRC

** Patched =devdns=

1. =git clone https://github.com/jsab/devdns.git=
2. =cd devdns=
3. =docker build -t devdns-patched .=

* Installation

1. Run =./macos_config.sh= once to configure your mac.

* Usage

1. If you have run this before, =rm client-config/*.ovpn= to clean up any past
   configurations.
2. Set =DOCKER_NETWORK= to the docker network you want to connect to. For
   example:
   #+begin_src sh
   export DOCKER_NETWORK=curbside-ad_default
   #+end_src
3. Run =docker-compose up -d= to spawn both the VPN and the DNS servers.
4. Run =./connectvpn.sh= to connect your mac host to the VPN.

The last step should print a message confirming the initialization completed
successfully:
#+begin_src
Initialization Sequence Completed
#+end_src

** Troubleshoot curbside-ad test failures:
- In case of multiple test failures, check if redis docker is accessible by `ping curbside-ad-redis`
  - If ping fails with following error: `ping: cannot resolve curbside-ad-redis: Unknown host`
    - Then clear dns cache with `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder` (verified on macOS Big Sur)
  - Else, check for `docker-compose logs dns` in curbside-docker-network
    - If dns logs have content like `Could not get IP for container curbside-ad-redis, probably not on network curbside-ad_default, skipping...`
      - Then issue is AD folder name mismatch. Rename it to `curbside-ad`.
      - Restart docker with `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up -d`
    - Else collect ip address from logs. It should be like `Added curbside-ad-redis.docker â†’ 172.20.0.4`
      - Try `ping <curbside-ad-repl-ip-address>`. If ping to ip is successful and `ping curbside-ad-redis` still fails, then flush dns
  - If still not solved, try system reboot
