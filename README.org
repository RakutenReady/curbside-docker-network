This project sets up a =curbside= docker network to be used by other projects
and provides the configuration to access that network from a dev macOS setup.

* Prerequisites

** =docker-compose=
Install [[https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac][docker desktop]]

** =openvpn=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew install openvpn
#+END_SRC

Make sure to export paths for `openvpn` bin in your ~/.zshrc
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:$PATH
#+END_SRC

* Usage

1. Run =make install= once to configure your mac.
2. Run =make up= to create the =curbside= network, launch the VPN to access it
   and the DNS server that will allow you to resolve names directly from your
   macos host.
3. Run =make connect= to connect your mac host to the VPN.

The last step should print a message confirming the initialization completed
successfully:
#+begin_src
Initialization Sequence Completed
#+end_src
