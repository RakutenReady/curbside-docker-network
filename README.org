This project sets up a =curbside= docker network to be used by other projects
and provides the configuration to access that network from a dev macOS setup.

* Prerequisites

1. =openvpn=
2. =docker-compose=

* Usage

1. Run =make install= once to configure your mac.
2. Run =make up= to create the =curbside= network, launch the VPN to access it
   and the DNS server that will allow you to resolve names directly from your
   macos host.
3. Run =make connect= to connect your mac host to the VPN.
